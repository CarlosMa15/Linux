This is our collaborative spreadsheet application for CS 3505 with Peter Jensen. It allows you to collaboratively maintain and edit software across
a network. The SpreadsheetGUI was created by Lukas Gust, Carlos Martinez in CS 3500 and modified by the authors of this
application for CS 3505. The SpreadsheetPanel was originally created by Prof. Joe Zachary for CS 3500 and modified by the authors of
this application for CS 3505.

/////How to connect//////////////////////////////////////////

To begin, the SpreadsheetServer project should be compiled and can be done with the make file. Once this is completed
the server can be started by entering ./spreadsheet_server into your terminal. The server will then begin listening for
new clients. Simultaneously, you can open the SpreadsheetGUI. 

/////Functionality - Server//////////////////////////////////////////

The server may be gracefully shutdown at any time by typing "quit" into the console.

/////Functionality - Client//////////////////////////////////////////

Once the GUI is up and running you will see a textbox in 
the upper right hand corner. Enter the URL of the cade machine that the server is running on and hit connect. At this 
point you can open a spreadsheet. You can either choose a preexisting spreadsheet by selecting from the dropdown, or type
the name of a new spreadsheet you would like to create.

Once you have joined a new session, you may start editing the spreadsheet itself, this can be accomplished by navigating 
using the arrow keys or by using your mouse to change the current selection, then when you want to edit simply type your
text/formula and hit either enter (to go down one cell) or tab (to go right one cell). Important: Arrow Keys will only
change the current selection and any new text will be removed and the previous state of that cell will be preserved.

The user may at anytime request to revert or undo the state of the cell/spreadsheet respectively. Reverts are cell local
changes that count as edits (they can be undone later if desired) and reverts the selected cell back to its previous state
(if it has one). Undos are spreadsheet global meaning that the previous state of the spreadsheet will be displayed/updated.

You may want to open a new spreadsheet, this can be done using the top left item on the menubar (File->New).
